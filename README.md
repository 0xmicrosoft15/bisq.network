# Bisq 2

Bisq 2 will be the successor to [Bisq v1](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq) and will support multiple trade
protocols, multiple privacy networks and multiple identities. Read more about Bisq 2 in
the [Bisq wiki](https://bisq.wiki/Bisq_2)

For the initial release Bisq 2 will come with the [Bisq Easy](https://bisq.wiki/Bisq_Easy) protocol only. Work on the
other protocols will start after Bisq 2 has been shipped.

Bisq Easy is designed for novice Bitcoin users with a focus on ease to use and convenience. It does not require that the
user has already Bitcoin and it is based on an easy-to-use chat interface. Security is based on reputation of the
Bitcoin seller. It does not compete with the current Bisq v1 trade protocol but is complementary to it. It serves and
targets a user group which we cannot reach with Bisq v1. You can read more about Bisq Easy
in [the Bisq wiki](https://bisq.wiki/Bisq_Easy).
