# Explorer node operator

Same as in Bisq 1 the explorer node delivers Bitcoin blockchain data.
It is used for transaction lookup and confirmation checks in the Bisq Easy trade protocol.

The explorer providers are currently defined in the `ExplorerService` class and is not distributed as Authorized data.
The BSQ bonding is not yet enforced by the system but by social consensus. In future the explorer nodes should follow
the same model as used for the other nodes.
