# Mediator

Traders can request mediation in case of problems. The trade chat will be then extended to a 3 party chat room and the
mediator will receive all past messages.
All messages are sent the other 2 participants.
In case of severe rule violation or scam the mediator can provide the evidence to the moderator who can ban the user.

After successful registration the mediator will see the Authorized role menu item and the mediator screen visible.
