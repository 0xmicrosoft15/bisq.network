# Mediator

When taking an offer the mediator gets selected based on the traders profile ID.
Traders can request mediation in case of problems. The trade chat will be then extended to a 3 party chat room and the
mediator will receive all past messages.
All messages are sent to the other 2 participants.
In case of severe rule violation or scam the mediator can report the user to the moderator and provide the evidence so
that the moderator can make the decision if it is justified to ban the user.

After successful registration the mediator will see the `Authorized role` menu item and the `Mediator` tab.
