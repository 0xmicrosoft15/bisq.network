# Moderator

Users can report mis-behaving users to a moderator(s). The moderator(s) receive the message and can contact both the
reporting
user and the accused user to figure out if the report was justified. In case of severe violations the moderator can ban
the reported user.
In case of scams or severe trade violations the mediator can provide evidence to the moderator who decides if it is
justified to ban a user. Depending on the reputation source the banned user has used, the report should get communicated
to the Bisq 1 developers and Bisq DAO for follow up consequences (e.g. make a BSQ bond confiscation request, ban user in
Bisq 1 network and ban their account age witness,...).

After successful registration the mediator will see the `Authorized role` menu item and the `Moderator` tab.
