## Verification of Bisq updates

If you have Bisq already installed it is best to update from inside the Bisq application and let Bisq perform the
signature verification. The Bisq application contains the PGP keys used for signing and those will be compared to the
signing key from the Github download page and the Bisq webpage. This provides an additional layer of security compared
to downloading and verifying it via the Github page only.

### Installer updates

Bisq use a launcher application which loads new versions dynamically without requiring a new installation. Only if the
launcher application changes itself you need to re-install Bisq.

### Software updates

For normal software updates you do not need to install Bisq but only download the `jar` file which will gets executed by
the Bisq launcher application at the next restart.

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our
wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

### Signing key

Url of the signing key (Alejandro Garc√≠a): https://bisq.network/pubkey/E222AA02.asc
Full fingerprint:

`B493 3191 06CC 3D1F 252E  19CB F806 F422 E222 AA02`

### Import the key:

`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/E222AA02.asc | gpg --import`

GPG prints a confusion warning: "This key is not certified with a trusted signature!". You can ignore that or read up
at https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

### How to verify signatures?

`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`

Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.9.11.dmg)

### Verify jar file inside binary:

You can verify on OSX the jar file with:

`shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq2.app/Contents/app/desktop-2.0.0-all.jar`
