## Bisq
######################################################


academy.bisq.subHeadline=Bisq is free and open source software for exchanging Bitcoin with Fiat currencies or other crypto-currencies in a decentralized and trust-minimized way.
academy.bisq.exchangeDecentralizedHeadline=Exchange, decentralized
academy.bisq.exchangeDecentralizedContent=Bisq is an exchange application where you can buy and sell Bitcoin for \
  national currencies or other cryptocurrencies. Unlike most exchange alternatives, Bisq is both decentralized and \ \
  peer-to-peer.\n\nIt is decentralized because it does not depend nor is it controlled by any single company, team or \
  government. Decentralization makes Bisq a resilient network: just like Bitcoin, it exists because of users like you. \
  Since there is no single element on which everything relies, it is significantly hard for anybody to stop or hurt \
  the network. It is peer-to-peer because each trade you perform is matched with another user just like you. This \
  helps you protect your privacy from centralized elements like governments and traditional financial institutions. It \
  also makes Bisq permissionless: you don't need anybody's authorization to use it, and nobody can stop you from doing \
  it.\n\nCurrently, two applications exist: Bisq 1 and Bisq 2. Bisq 2 is the application where you are reading this. \
  We recommend you to get acquainted with Bisq 2 before you try to learn more about Bisq 1.
academy.bisq.whyBisqHeadline=Why Bisq
academy.bisq.whyBisqContent=For many users, Bisq is the preferred method to buy or sell Bitcoin in exchange for national\
  \ currencies. This is because Bisq's nature results in a completely different experience to that of Centralized \
  Exchanges.\n\nMany users value the privacy-respecting nature of Bisq. You don't need to provide any kind of \
  personal information to use Bisq. Whenever you trade, you only need to share your payment details with your trade\
  \ partner. Nobody else has access to this data, and there is no central database where all of your information and \
  transactions will end up stored for years or decades.\n\nBisq also allows users to overcome any lack of permissions\
  \ that can be imposed arbitrarily by their local governments or financial institutions. Examples of this can be\
  \ governments that declare Bitcoin possession or trading illegal, or banks that forbid customers from sending their\
  \ own money to exchange institutions. Users in these situations find in Bisq a way to work around them being\
  \ excluded from the traditional financial system for any kind of reason.\n\nFinally, Bisq is a safe way to exchange\
  \ Bitcoin and national currencies. The existing trade protocols and reputation systems prevent bad actors from\
  \ stealing your funds. Mediators are always available to support you if another peer is not behaving properly and\
  \ will step in if necessary to work out a solution for your case. The result: Bisq users can happily trade with\
  \ others without having to worry about losing their funds.
academy.bisq.tradeSafelyHeadline=Trade safely
academy.bisq.tradeSafelyContent=Exchanging your Bitcoin and national currencies with other peers comes with great \
  benefits like not depending on companies or protecting your privacy. But you might be wondering: how can I know if \
  the peer I'm trading with is honest? Won't I get scammed? Those are valid concerns that you should always keep in \
  mind and that Bisq addresses in several ways to allow safe trading.\n\nThe different trade protocols (you can think\
  \ of a protocol as the rules you and your peer will have to follow) minimize the risk of any actor scamming his peer\
  \ during a trade. You can read more in detail about the different protocols available in Bisq 1 and Bisq 2 here\
  \ #TODO: add link. There is usually a trade-off between security and convenience: some protocols are more robust,\
  \ others are more convenient and fast. It is up to you to decide which protocol to use on each trade, depending on\
  \ your preferences and needs, as well as the traded amount. Protocols like Bisq Easy are recommended for small sums\
  \ of money, while more robust and structured protocols like Bisq Multisig are advisable for larger amounts.\n\nIf\
  \ your trade ends up in a conflict with your trade peer, or the peer simply disappears and becomes unresponsive, you\
  \ will not be left alone. Mediators and arbitrators are always available to advice and provide solutions in these\
  \ situations. These roles will observe each case, propose friendly solutions between the traders, and potentially\
  \ make final decisions if no agreements are reached. If you have acted honestly and followed the rules, the outcomes\
  \ will be in your favor and you will never lose your funds. You can read more about mediation and arbitration here\
  \ #TODO: add link.\n\nIn summary, Bisq is designed to minimize the need for trusting other peers and to discourage\
  \ scamming and other bad behaviors. This translates in very few trades having any kind of conflict, and those which\
  \ do will always be solved in a reasonable way through mediation and/or arbitration. The result: trading in Bisq is\
  \ a safe and smooth experience.

academy.bitcoin.subHeadline=A peer-to-peer electronic cash that allows online payments to be sent directly without intermediaries.
academy.bitcoin.whatIsBitcoinHeadline=What is Bitcoin
academy.bitcoin.whatIsBitcoinContent=Bitcoin is the largest and most popular cryptocurrency in the world. It is a \
  digital form of cash that allows anybody to send value to other people without the need for intermediaries. It \
  started out in 2009 and has grown massively since then, gaining adoption throughout the world because of its unique \
  and appealing properties.\n\nBitcoin differs from all national currencies in several aspects. Bitcoin is not \
  controlled or issued by any government or institution. It is decentralized, and it exists only because of the \
  thousands of people across the world who use it. This makes it neutral money, where nobody is in a privileged \
  position that allows abuse. This also means that you are free to use Bitcoin without requiring any kind of \
  permission, and nobody in the system has more power than you. It's an open system that welcomes everyone. Another \
  important property is that you can hold Bitcoin in self-custody. In other words, you can own it yourself without \
  depending on any other company or entity. Comparing it to traditional currencies, it's more similar to cash in your \
  pocket (which you completely control) than to a balance in a bank account (where you are subject to the bank's \
  conditions and wishes). Because of this, you are also always free to send Bitcoin: you don't need anybody's approval \
  to do so, and your transactions can't be stopped or reversed. A third interesting aspect is that Bitcoin's supply is \
  limited to a maximum of 21 million. This means that the value of each bitcoin, unlike the value of each dollar for \
  example, can't be debased by creating more of it. Bitcoin is created through a costly process called mining, and the \
  amount and schedule that can be created through mining is strictly defined and can't be modified. This makes the \
  supply limited and certain, making Bitcoin attractive due to its scarcity.
academy.bitcoin.whyUseBitcoinHeadline=Why use Bitcoin
academy.bitcoin.whyUseBitcoinContent=Bitcoin's properties make it a unique asset that attracts different people for \
  different reasons. How Bitcoin appeals to you depends on your profile and needs.\n\nOne of the most common reasons \
  for people to use Bitcoin is its capacity to protect value over time. The national currencies of most countries in \
  the world lose value continuously over time due to currency debasement. This means that by holding your savings in \
  cash or in a bank account, you are gradually losing them because their value goes down over time. Bitcoin's limited \
  supply prevents this from happening, so even if it behaves in a volatile way in the short term, it is a powerful \
  tool to preserve your wealth in the long term.\n\nAnother reason for individuals to use Bitcoin is to protect \
  themselves from the actions and decisions of governments and financial institutions. Since Bitcoin is something you \
  can own, send, and receive in a permission-less way, the value stored in it is not affected by situations like a \
  central bank printing more units of its national currency, a bank deciding to block your transfers for arbitrary \
  reasons, or a government imposing confiscations on its population. With Bitcoin, the rules of the game are \
  well-known and predictable, and you can count on the network being fair and treating everyone equally.\n\nBitcoin \
  is also very attractive for those who engage in international trade and seek to send or receive money to other \
  countries or regions. Bitcoin has no concept of borders and works the same whether you send some to your neighbor or \
  to someone on the other side of the world. Since making payments to people or companies in different regions of the \
  world usually means long waiting times, significant fees, and cumbersome red tape, some people chose Bitcoin as a \
  simple and convenient alternative for their cross-region payments. It also means that you can use it to send money \
  to countries that your government or bank have decided to block.\n\nFinally, some people chose Bitcoin for its \
  simplicity and convenience. Bitcoin presents many advantages in this sense with respect to traditional currencies. \
  With it, you don't need to deal with contracts and long bureaucratic processes to do simple things like opening an \
  account. You can easily access your money on all your devices. You can send it anywhere and to anyone without the \
  need for different forms of payment (cash, bank transfers of different sorts, credit cards, etc.). You can easily \
  protect and secure your funds with the right knowledge, and you will enjoy not having to worry about someone \
  stealing your wallet or credit card details.\n\nBitcoin is a huge and innovative step forward in the world of money \
  and payments. There is almost certainly some reason for which Bitcoin can be attractive and useful for your needs, \
  so we encourage you to learn more and to become familiar with it.

academy.security.subHeadline=Ensuring you, and only you, always have access to your funds
academy.security.introContent=Because Bitcoin is quite different from national currencies in the way it works, the \
  precautions you need to take are also quite different from what you are probably used to. This is also a highly \
  important topic because, while Bitcoin provides you with a lot of power and freedom, it also makes you responsible \
  for taking care of your funds. Therefore, you should invest some time and effort to learn how to do so securely.\
  \n\nWhile security is a complex topic, we can boil things down to three main goals: to ensure that other people never\
  \ have access to your private keys, to ensure that you always have access to your private keys, and to avoid \
  accidentally sending your bitcoin away to scammers and other untrusted peers.
academy.security.securingYourKeysHeadline=Securing your keys
academy.security.securingYourKeysContent=First of all, you must understand one simple idea: not your keys, not your \
  coins. This means that, in order for you to truly own your Bitcoin, it should be stored in a wallet where you, and \
  only you, own the keys. This means that a Bitcoin balance in entities such as banks and centralized exchanges is not \
  really Bitcoin that you own since it's those entities, and not you, who hold the keys to your funds. If you truly \
  want to own your bitcoin, you must store it in a wallet for which only you control the keys.\n\nThere are many \
  Bitcoin wallets out there, each with its own unique design and features. What they all have in common is that, \
  somehow, somewhere, they will store your private keys. These keys provide access to your funds. Whatever wallet you \
  use, you must make sure that only you, or people you fully trust, have access to these keys. If anyone else has \
  access to them, they will be able to steal your funds from you, and nothing can be done to reverse this transaction. \
  On the other hand, losing the keys yourself is equally terrible. If you lose your keys, you will not be able to send \
  your funds anymore, and there is no way to take back control of them. While this might sound daunting, you can \
  easily avoid these situations with a bit of learning and good practices.\n\nMost bitcoin wallets will provide you \
  with a 12 or 24 words long backup, commonly known as the mnemonic phrase or simply the seedphrase. This backup \
  phrase allows you to restore your wallet on any device, making it the most important element for you to secure. It \
  is generally advised to store these backups in analogical form, typically by writing them on a piece of paper or on a \
  small metal sheet, and to have multiple copies of them. You should also store it so that you can find it if you need \
  it, but no one else can access it.\n\nFor significant amounts of Bitcoin, it's usual to employ specialized devices \
  called Hardware Wallets to store your keys. These devices offer a superior level of security with respect to storing \
  your keys in a smartphone or laptop wallet, while providing a convenient experience when it comes to making \
  transactions. You can learn more about these and other types of wallets in the Wallets section of Bisq Learn.\
  \n\nFinally, make sure to avoid overly complicated storage schemes. An advanced storage plan with many details and \
  subtleties will keep thieves away from your funds, but there is also a significant chance that you might not be able \
  to access your own wallet due to mistakes, confusion, or simply forgetting how you organized the backups. Aim for a \
  balance between a set-up that is too simple and anybody could easily break (like storing your seedphrase in a plain \
  text file on your laptop's desktop) and one that is so complex that not even you can crack (like storing the words \
  of your phrase across 12 books in 12 different locations).
academy.security.avoidScamsHeadline=Avoid scams
academy.security.avoidScamsContent=Another source of problems and risks are scams. Bitcoin's transactions are \
  irreversible, which means that if someone tricks you into sending them some Bitcoin and then runs away with it, \
  there isn't really much that you can do about it. Because of this, it is common to encounter different schemes where \
  people will try to convince you to send some bitcoin to them. Most of the time, scammers will present you with some \
  wonderful "opportunity" for you to earn money easily, which tends to sound too good to be true. The specific stories \
  and details surrounding these scams are extremely diverse and creative, but the common pattern will always look the \
  same: you will be offered some wonderful returns, but first, you will have to send bitcoin in advance. Once the \
  bitcoin is sent, you will probably never see it come back to you. Defending yourself against these scams is simple: \
  interact only with reputable and trusted companies and people. If you feel some entity is sketchy, ask for \
  references or simply steer away from it. If you are offered an opportunity that feels almost too good to be true, it \
  probably is, and you should stay away from it.
