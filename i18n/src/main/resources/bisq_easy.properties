tradeGuide.header.tooltip=Click to collapse or expand trade guide

tradeGuide.welcome.headline=How to trade on Bisq Easy
tradeGuide.welcome.content=This guide will give you an overview about the important aspects for buying or selling Bitcoin \
  with Bisq Easy.\n\n\
  You will learn about the security model used at Bisq Easy, how the trade process works and the trade rules.\n\n\
  If you have any further questions visit the chat rooms at the 'Support' menu.
tradeGuide.welcome.content.notYetConfirmed=Once you have confirmed to have read and understood the trade guide will close, and you can start trading in the trade chat.\n\
  You can open that trade guide again by clicking the '?' icon on the top menu.

tradeGuide.tab1.headline=Security model
tradeGuide.tab1.content=\
  - The security model of Bisq Easy is best for small trade amounts\n\
  - It's based on the reputation of the seller\n\
  - The seller is usually an experienced Bisq user and is expected to be helpful and supportive for users who are new to Bisq.\n\
  - Building up reputation can be costly. A price premium of about 10-15% is common to reflect those extra costs and to compensate for the service that the seller offers.\n\
  - By default, private messages are only accessible to sellers with a certain level of reputation, but users can opt out from that protection.\n\
  - Trading with sellers without reputation carries significant risks and should be only done if the risks are well understood and managed.

tradeGuide.tab2.headline=Trade process
tradeGuide.tab2.content=\
  1. The offer maker defines the trade terms, if this was not already defined in the maker's user profile.\n\
  2. Once the traders have agreed on the trade terms (e.g. payment method and trade price) the trade starts.\n\
  3. The seller transmits the payment account details to the buyer (e.g. bank account number). The buyer sends the BTC address to the seller.\n\
  4. The buyer starts the Fiat payment to the sellers account and sends the seller a message that the payment is in transit.\n\
  5. Once the seller has received the Fiat payment they send the Bitcoin to the buyers address.\n\
  6. After the buyer received the Bitcoin the trade is completed.

tradeGuide.tab3.headline=Trade rules
tradeGuide.tab3.content=\
  - Before the payment details are exchanged the trade can be canceled by any party without justification.\n\
  - After the payment details are exchanged not fulfilling the trade obligations is considered a breach of the trade contract and can lead to getting banned from the network.\n\
  - When sending the Fiat the buyer MUST NOT use any term in the 'reason for payment' field which relates to 'Bisq' or 'Bitcoin'. The traders can agree on an identifier to associate the bank transfer to the trade (e.g. a random string like 'H3TJAPD').\n\
  - If the trade cannot be completed instantly because the Fiat transfer takes longer, both traders have to be online at least once a day to follow up the trade process.\n\
  - If there are any open questions or problems the traders can use the support chat, invite a mediator into their trade chat or get in touch with Bisq support team on the Matrix channel at 'https://bisq.chat'.
