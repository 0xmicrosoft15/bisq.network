# Keep display strings organized by domain
# Naming convention: We use camelCase and dot separated name spaces.
# Use as many sub spaces as required to make the structure clear, but as little as possible.
# E.g.: [main-view].[component].[description]
# In some cases we use enum values or constants to map to display strings. Those cannot be detected by IDE and 
# might show incorrectly as unused.

# An annoying issue with property files is that we need to use 2 single quotes in display string
# containing variables (e.g. {0}), otherwise the variable will not be resolved.
# In display string which do not use a variable a single quote is ok.
# E.g. Don''t .... {1}

# Hyperlinks in popups can be added via: [HYPERLINK:https://....]. They will get displayed as enumerated footer notes.

# We use sometimes dynamic parts which are put together in the code and therefore sometimes use line breaks or spaces
# at the end of the string. Please never remove any line breaks or spaces.
# To make longer strings better readable you can make a line break with \ which does not result in a line break
# in the string, only in the editor.

# Please use in all language files the exact same order of the entries, that way comparison is easier.

# Please try to keep the length of the translated string similar to English. If it is longer it might break layout or
# get truncated. We will need some adjustments in the UI code to support that, but we want to keep effort at the minimum.
