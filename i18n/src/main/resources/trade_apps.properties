## Protocols roadmap
######################################################



tradeApps.LIQUID_SWAP.subHeadline=Atomic swap based trade protocol on the Liquid side-chain for trading any Liquid asset
tradeApps.LIQUID_SWAP.overview=To use Liquid swaps the user need to install and run the Elements wallet and configure it, so that it can be accessed from the Bisq application.\n\n\
  The most widely used asset on Liquid is USDT (Tether) - a stable coin pegged to the USD. While this is not comparable to something like Bitcoin, it has many advantages over Fiat USD which involves usually bank transfers with all the problems and inconvenience of the legacy Fiat system.\n\n\
  L-BTC might be used on the other end of the trade which is a substitute of Bitcoin on the Liquid chain. To convert Bitcoin to L-BTC one need to send Bitcoin to a  peg-in address and will receive after 102 confirmations L-BTC for that. Going back from L-BTC to Bitcoin (peg-out)  works similar but requires authorisation from the Liquid federation which is a group of companies and individuals in the Bitcoin space. So it is not a completely trust-less process.\n\n\
  One should avoid comparing Liquid assets to the properties of Bitcoin. It targets other use cases and cannot meet the high level of decentralisation and censorship resistance of Bitcoin. It can be seen rather as an alternative to traditional financial products. By using blockchain technology it avoids classical intermediaries, improves security and privacy and provides a better user experience.
tradeApps.LIQUID_SWAP.release=Liquid swaps are still in development. It is expected to be released in Q1/2024.
tradeApps.LIQUID_SWAP.tradeOffs=\
  + Confidential transactions provide good privacy\n\
  + Fast confirmation time of about 1 minute\n\
  + Low transaction fees\n\
  + Suitable for high value transactions\n\n\
  - Requires running the Elements wallet and blockchain\n\
  - Both traders need to be online\n\
  - Peg-out from L-BTC is not trust-less


tradeApps.MONERO_SWAP.subHeadline=Atomic cross-chain swap protocol for trading Bitcoin with Monero
tradeApps.MONERO_SWAP.overview=Based on the Farcaster project (funded by the Monero community) using hashed time lock contracts (HTLC), adaptor signatures and zero-knowledge proof for atomically swapping Bitcoin and Monero.\n\n\
  The user needs to install and run a Bitcoin node, a Monero node and the Farcaster daemon. During the swap, the nodes of both traders need to be online. The extra effort when using that protocol pays off with a very high level of security. \
  Though users should make themselves familiar with the details of that concept and be aware that there are edge case carrying some small risks.
tradeApps.MONERO_SWAP.release=Monero swaps are expected to be ready for release in Q3/2023.
tradeApps.MONERO_SWAP.tradeOffs=\
  + Very secure\n\
  + Decent privacy. On the Bitcoin side it inherits Bitcoin's privacy properties. On the Monero side it benefits from the high privacy of Monero.\n\
  + Suitable for high value transactions\n\n\
  - It requires some technical skills and experience to run the required infrastructure\n\
  - Confirmation time is based on the confirmations on both blockchains which will be usually about 20-30 min.\n\
  - Transaction fees on the Bitcoin side could be non-trivial in case of high blockchain congestion (rather rare, though)\n\
  - Both traders need to be online\n\
  - It requires lots of fast disk storage for the nodes


tradeApps.BISQ_MULTISIG.subHeadline=Based on a security deposit, a 2-of-2 Multisig transaction and a multi layer dispute resolution process
tradeApps.BISQ_MULTISIG.overview=Conceptually it follows the trade protocol used in Bisq 1, though the new Bisq Multisig protocol comes with some improvements:\n\n\
  - It avoids the maker-fee and taker-fee transactions and reduces by that the total number of involved transactions to 2 (maybe even to 1, but this has to be further investigated).\n\
  - Another open research area is to replace the delayed payout transaction by using a Taproot branch.\n\
  - The most important aspect though is to replace the manual role of the burningman by a smart contract. There is still not a satisfying solution found in that area, but we hope to be able to solve that.
tradeApps.BISQ_MULTISIG.release=Bisq Multisig is expected to be ready for release in Q4/2023.
tradeApps.BISQ_MULTISIG.tradeOffs=\
  + Reasonable good security for medium value trade amounts\n\
  + Compared to Bisq Easy the security properties are better and higher amounts can be traded. The higher amounts bring trade prices closer to market rates.\n\
  + Manages to deal with the legacy system of the Fiat world\n\n\
  - Both traders need to have BTC for the security deposit\n\
  - The makers Bisq node need to be online as the take-offer process is interactive\n\
  - As the Fiat transfer is done on legacy systems like bank transfers it inherits all those drawbacks, like chargeback risk, slow transfer, privacy exposure to peer when the bank transfer details contain the real name. Though those various drawbacks can be mitigated by using payment methods which carry low chargeback risk, are fast or instant and use account IDs or email instead of real names. Certain payment methods avoid banking system completely like cash-by-mail or trading face to face.

tradeApps.BSQ_SWAP.subHeadline=Atomic swap between BSQ (colored coin on Bitcoin) and Bitcoin
tradeApps.BSQ_SWAP.overview=Same model as used in Bisq 1. As it is based on one single atomic transaction it is very secure.\n\
  It will require to run the Bisq 1 node with the DAO API enabled.
tradeApps.BSQ_SWAP.release=BSQ swaps is expected to be ready for release in Q2/2024.
tradeApps.BSQ_SWAP.tradeOffs=\
  + Very secure\n\
  + Relative fast, thought only after the blockchain confirmation the trade is considered complete\n\
  + No maker fee transaction and no security deposit required\n\n\
  - Need to run Bisq 1 for the BSQ/DAO data\n\
  - Limited to BSQ/BTC market

tradeApps.LIGHTNING_X.subHeadline=Three-party protocol for trading Fiat with Bitcoin on Lightning Network.
tradeApps.LIGHTNING_X.overview=It is based on multiple Lightning payments and splits up the secrets for the HTLCs to construct a secure setup where the 3rd party guarantees that the traders behave fair. It uses garbled circuits to achieve secure multi party computation.\n\n\
  The user needs to run a Lightning node which is configured with the Bisq application.\n\n\
  Conceptually it is similar to the Bisq Multisig protocol but instead of the Multisig transaction it uses this 3-party set-up and instead of on-chain Bitcoin it uses Bitcoin on Lightning Network.
tradeApps.LIGHTNING_X.release=Lightning-X is expected to be ready for release in Q4/2023.
tradeApps.LIGHTNING_X.tradeOffs=\
  + Compared to Bisq Easy the security properties are better and higher amounts can be traded. The higher amounts bring trade prices closer to market rates.\n\
  + The Bitcoin payments are near instant\n\
  + Very low transaction (routing) fees\n\n\
  - Need to run a Lightning node\n\
  - Both traders need to have BTC (on Lightning) for the security deposit.\n\
  - The makers Bisq node need to be online as the take-offer process is interactive.\n\
  - As the Fiat transfer is done on legacy systems like bank transfers it inherits all those drawbacks, like chargeback risk, slow transfer, privacy exposure to peer when the bank transfer details contain the real name. Though those various drawbacks can be mitigated by using payment methods which carry low chargeback risk, are fast or instant and use account IDs or email instead of real names. Certain payment methods avoid banking system completely like cash-by-mail or trading face to face.
